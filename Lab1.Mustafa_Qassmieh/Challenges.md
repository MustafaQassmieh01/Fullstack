### learning points:
* things like the difference between mongoose.connect and mongoose.createConnection and how connect makes it simpler and automatic if you are only using 1 db(or like one url for it, i think you can still use different collections inside the same cluster so long as you make a model for them)
* i thik this mistake i did before and i just forgot that it happend, whenever  you change the id inside the mongodb (for simplicity) it really doesn't help 
* always check for twisted letters in your if statements when in doubt 
* postman can show you the raw res so use it
* i think if you look at the code you can tell when i start paniking or frantically solving problems in specific methods, i guess a good call might have been to spam console.log messages before making any changes 

**thing is this is supposed to be like 2 lines but i can go on**; one of the challenges i was going to ask chatgpt when i discovered brainstorming halfway into writing the prompt was like how do i put a list inside of a component (ingredients inside the recipe), then i made like the dom.list thing, um i did not like the fact that the user can see the ids, so i had the idea to make like a dictionary (server side like in the controller or in a completely different file) and pass a fake id to them and transforming that into the actual id when req or sending to the db server. kinda proud of that.

figuring out like the mechanics behind uppend child ( think of it like this, if i have some spans i can later make their display inline-block so more horizontal, if i put them inside a div or any element and just uppend the name for examle just before i uppend the span container...) it's just cool to keep in mind that what ever you append reaches first and your class or element type fixes their struct for the most part.

oh yea for next time, it is confusing to take two classes and try to add them together in main, as in fill one into another inside a third class next time i might just wanna take the fetch class and just dump an object of it indo the html handler to do the inside tasks. this way mentally keeping track of it is easier.
